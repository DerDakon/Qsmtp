To force recoding: =E2=82=AC=E2=82=AC

lines with whitespace and safe characters, should trigger the "add one mo=
re character" branch in recode_qp().

 a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a=
 a a a a a a a a
a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a=
 a a a a a a a a a

The same with unsafe characters so this doesn't trigger falsely:

Ok, this time with UTF8 data:
