.SH NAME
Qremote \- send mail via (E)SMTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Qemote
.I host
.I sender
.I recip
[
.I recip ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Qemote
reads a mail message from its standard input and sends 
the message to one or more recipients at a remote host.
The standard input must be a descriptor of a file opened 
for reading, Qremote will fstat(2) and mmap(2) it.

The remote host is
.BR Qremote 's
first argument,
.IR host .
.B Qremote
sends the message to
.IR host ,
or to a mail exchanger for
.I host
listed in the Domain Name System,
via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
.I host
can be either a fully-qualified domain name:

.EX
     mail.example.com
.EE

or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

.EX
     [192.0.2.19]
.EE

or an IPv6 address enclosed in brackets:

.EX
     [::ffff:192.0.2.19]
.EE

The envelope recipient addresses are listed as
.I recip
arguments to
.BR Qremote .
The envelope sender address is listed as
.I sender\fP.

.SH TRANSPARENCY
End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.
A dot at the beginning of a line is encoded as dot dot.
It is impossible in SMTP to send a message that does not end with a newline.
.B Qremote
converts single CR or LF into the SMTP newline convention by converting them
to CRLF.

If the message contains non-ascii characters the message is encoded
as quoted-printable if the remote server does not support the 8BITMIME
extension defined in RfC 1652. If a message contains lines with more than
1000 characters it is always recoded to quoted-printable, sending such a
long line would be a SMTP protocol violation.

.B Qremote
supports the CHUNKING extension defined in RfC 3030. If the remote server
supports CHUNKING no message recoding is done at all.
.SH "RESULTS"
.B Qremote
prints some number of 
.I recipient reports\fP,
followed by a
.I message report\fR.
Each report is terminated by a 0 byte.
Each report begins with a single letter:
.TP 5
r
Recipient report: acceptance.
.TP 5
h
Recipient report: permanent rejection.
.TP 5
s
Recipient report: temporary rejection.
.TP 5
K
Message report: success.
.I host
has taken responsibility for delivering the message to each
acceptable recipient.
.TP 5
Z
Message report: temporary failure.
.TP 5
D
Message report: permanent failure.
.PP
After this letter comes a human-readable description of
what happened. No human readable description is printed
after 'r' status report (qmail-rspawn would get confused
otherwise).

The recipient reports will always be printed in the same order as
.BR Qremote 's
.I recip
arguments.
Note that in failure cases there may be fewer
recipient reports
than
.I recip
arguments.

.B Qremote
always exits zero.
.SH "CONTROL FILES"
.TP 5
.I clientcert.pem
SSL certificate that is used to authenticate with the remote server
during a TLS session.
.TP 5
.I helohost
Current host name,
for use solely in saying hello to the remote SMTP server.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise
.B Qremote
refuses to run.
.TP 5
.I smtproutes
Artificial SMTP routes.
Each route has the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIrelay ,
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
.B Qremote
will connect to
.IR relay ,
as if
.I host
had
.I relay
as its only MX.
(It will also avoid doing any CNAME lookups on
.IR recip .)
.I host
may include a colon and a port number to use instead of the
normal SMTP port, 25:

.EX
   foo.example.com:mx2.example.com:24
.EE

.I relay
may be empty;
this tells
.B Qremote
to look up MX records as usual.
.I smtproutes
may include wildcards:

.EX
   .example.org:
   :baz.example.org:24
.EE

Here
any address ending with
.B .example.org
(but not
.B example.org
itself)
is routed by its MX records;
any other address is artificially routed to
.BR foo.example.org
port 24.

The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you create an artificial
mail loop between machines.
However,
you are always safe using
.I smtproutes
if you do not accept mail from the network.
.TP 5
.I smtproutes.d
Artificial SMTP routes.

A file can be created for each domain to specify a
specific routing. Wildcard routings may be created using
a file beginning with a single
.I *
as subdomain, e. g.

.EX
  *.example.net
.EE

Each file contains
.I key=value
pairs defining the mapping. Currently the following keys are supported:

.I host
The hostname of the target machine.

.I port
The port on the remote machine to connect to.

These files allow easier addition of new fields without making the file
unreadable. Otherwise they behave the same as the single smtproutes file.

Given the domain
.I foo.example.net
the following lookups will be performed:

.EX
 smtproutes.d/foo.example.net
 smtproutes.d/*.example.net
 smtproutes.d/*.net
 smtproutes.d/default
 smtproutes
.EE

The search is terminated on the first match.
Please note that a wildcards subdomain does not match mails
with the absolute destination of the remainder, e. g.
.I *.example.net
does not match for a mail sent to
.I foo@example.net
.

The following example would route mails to port 24 on
.I baz.example.org
:

.EX
   host=baz.example.org
   port=24
.EE

.TP 5
.I timeoutconnect
Number of seconds
.B Qremote
will wait for the remote SMTP server to accept a connection.
Default: 60.
The kernel normally imposes a 75-second upper limit.
.TP 5
.I timeoutremote
Number of seconds
.B Qremote
will wait for each response from the remote SMTP server.
Default: 1200.

.TP 5
.I tlsclientciphers
A set of OpenSSL client cipher strings. Multiple ciphers
contained in a string should be separated by a colon.

.TP 5
.I tlshosts/<FQDN>.pem
.B Qremote
requires authentication from servers for which this certificate exists
.RB ( <FQDN>
is the fully-qualified domain name of the server). One of the
.I DNSname
or the
.I CommonName
attributes have to match.

.B WARNING:
this option may cause mail to be delayed, bounced, doublebounced, or lost.
