<h1>Frequently asked questions about Qsmtp</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="#qremote-kernel-ipv6">Why is Qremote always failing with &quot;can't_connect_to_any_server&quot;</a></li>
<li><a href="#aoldiff">Why can't I send mails to AOL?</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="qremote-kernel-ipv6">Why is Qremote always failing with &quot;can't_connect_to_any_server&quot;</h2>
<p>This happens when your libc supports IPv6 addresses, but your kernel does not. When Qremote tries to open an IPv6 socket to send the mail the syscall fails. Recompile with -DIPV4ONLY.</p>
<h2 id="aoldiff">Why can't I send mails to AOL?</h2>
<p>AOL uses a multiline opening in the SMTP connection. It's not absolutely clear if this is a violation of RfC 2821, but it's at least suspicios. Apply patches/AOL-greeting.diff and rebuild, then you can send mail to them again.</p>
<h2 id="localpartlendiff">Why can't I use ezmlm mailing lists?</h2>
<p>Control messages like subscription confirmation messages of mailing lists run by <a href="http://www.ezmlm.org">ezmlm</a> bounce with &quot;domain of mail address is syntactically incorrect&quot;. This happens because ezmlm breaks the length limit for localparts. RfC 822 and 2822 both tell a localpart is not allowed to exceed 64 characters. Apply patches/localpart-len.diff to allow localparts up to 256 characters. Note: this file is not included in version 0.8, you have to get it from the <a href="http://opensource.sf-tec.de/repos/Qsmtp/">subversion repository</a>.</p>
