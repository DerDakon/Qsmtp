=============== AUTH stuff =================
The authentication part is taken from qmail-smtpd-auth-0.31, which has
this credits:

This patch adds ESMTP AUTH authentication protocol support to
qmail-1.03.  It's originally based on Mrs. Brisby's smtp-auth patch
with many enhancements from Krzysztof Dabrowski <brush@elysium.pl>.

Beginning with version 0.30, the patch was completely rewritten to
use only djb's string functions by Eric M. Johnston <emj@postal.net>.
