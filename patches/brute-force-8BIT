This patch reverts Qremote to qmail-remote behaviour if the message contains
8 bit characters and the remote host does not announce 8BITMIME: just send
the mail. This behaviour has caused no problems to me (or at least I never
noticed them) but it violates the RfC. You might need this patch if some of
your clients send mails with "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit". Hopefully
I will add quoted-printable recoding one day and this can go away then.
